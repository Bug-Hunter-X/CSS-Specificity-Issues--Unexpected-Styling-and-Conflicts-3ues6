The following corrected CSS rules use more specific selectors to avoid unexpected style application:

```css
/* Using ID for more precise targeting */
#myDiv p { color: blue; }

/* Using class for more precise targeting */
p.special { color: blue; }

/* Using direct child selector for better specificity */
div > p { color: blue; }

/* Being more explicit about the parent and child */
.container p.special { color: blue; }
```

These revisions demonstrate how to pinpoint the elements you want to style more precisely, removing the unintentional styling from other parts of your webpage.
