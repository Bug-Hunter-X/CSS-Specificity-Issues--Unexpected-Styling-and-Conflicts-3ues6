The following CSS rule uses a selector that's too specific or too general, causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
```

This rule will apply to all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>` element. This might be too specific if you only want to target certain `<p>` elements.

**Problem:** Over specificity or lack of specificity can lead to unintended style application or style conflicts.

**Example:** If you have a nested structure like:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Both paragraphs will be styled with `color: blue;` due to the rule's generality.

**Solution:** Use more precise selectors that specify the context of the elements you're targeting.

```css
#my-div p { color: blue; } /* More specific, only applies to paragraphs within div with id="my-div" */

p.special { color: blue; } /* More specific, only applies to paragraphs with class="special" */

div > p { color: blue; } /* More specific, applies only to paragraphs that are direct children of a div */
```
